    "text2=\"I have three visions for India, In 3000 years of our history, people from all over the world have come and invadealus, captured our Lands, conquered our ainds From Alexander onwards, the Greeks, the Turks, the Hoguls, the Portuguese, the British, The French, the Dutch, all of them cane and looted us, took over what was ours. Vet we have not done this to any other nation, we have not conquered anyone We have not grabbed their land, their culture, their history and tried to enforce our way of life on them. Why? Because we respect the freedom of others. That is why ny first vision is that of freedom. I believe that India got its first vision of this in 1857, when we started the kar of Independence. It is this freedom that we must protect and nurture and build on. If we are not free, no one will respect us. My second vision for India's development. For fifty fi years we have been a developing nation. It is time we see ourselves as a developed nation. We are among the top 5 nations of the world In terms of GDP. We have a 18 percent growth rate in most areas. Our poverty levels are falling. Our achievements are being globally recognised today. Vet ve lack the self-confidence to a developed nation, self-reliant and and self-assured. Isn't this Incorrect? I have a third vision. India must stand up to the world. Because I believe that unless India stands up to the world, no one will respect us. Only strength respects strength, we must be strong not only as a military power but also as an economic power, Buth must go hand-in-hand. My good fortune was to have worked with three great minds. Dr. Vikram Sarabhal of the Dept. of space, Professor Satish Dhawan, who succeeded him and Dr. Brahm Prakash, father of nuclear material. I was lucky to have worked with all three of then closely and consider this the great opportunity of my life. I see four allestones in my career\""
